							For bottoms, my favourite color is khaki, and I recommend khaki jeans and khaki chinos, there's a bunch of different shades of khaki so you can get as many as you want. I prefer this to blue jeans because it's just a little different. If you want to go for other colors then I recommend dark blue, grey, dark red or green, and if you like blue jeans you can get a pair too. Also, if you live somewhere hot, and you want to wear shorts, that's fine, just make sure they don't go below the knee because that's too long. Also if you're wearing shorts, either don't wear your button-downs with them, or roll up the sleeves.</br>For shoes, I recommend canvas sneakers. They're casual enough to wear with anything but they're also not AS casual as running shoes so they look a little more stylish. If you want to look even more stylish you can try a pair of chukka boots and if you want to be a little more casual you can go for a sneaker like Roshes or Ultra Boots. I recommend not working out in the same you wear to go out, because dirty scuffed up shoes tuin and entire outfit.</br>If it's cold where you live, go for a nice subtle sweater, cardigan, or jacket to round out the look. Don't just throw something on, thinking "oh it's just the outer layer, it doesn't matter." Because it does matter!</br>If you want to wear sunglasses, go for a slightly more professional design. In general you want to avoid stuff like Oakleys and ones they sell at gas stations because those usually look too sporty... which is fine if you actually ARE playing sports, but they don't really go with this look. Also, if you're at the store and you're not sure if something looks good, just ask the salesguy. Just pick one of the guys who looks like he's dressed well and ask him. Don't ask a guy who isn't dressed well, because if he can't do it himself then he obviously won't be much help. And don't ask a girl, because you'll be more likely to buy expensive stuff to try to impress her - don't forger you actual goal, which is to leave the store with stuff that you're actually gonna wear, not blow your entire budget on a $600 leather jacket because the hot salesgirl told you you looked good in it. the other good thing about this style is that everything goes with everything else. Every top goes with pretty much every bottom, which goes with every pair of shoes, which goes with every sweater and jacket. So you can make a ton of different outfits. Let's say you get 5 t-shirts, 2 button downs, 3 pairs of pants, 2 pairs of shoes, 1 sweater and 1 jacket. That's literally ONE HUNDRED ADN TWENTY SIX outfits you can make. I don't know about you, but when I was in high school, there'd always be guys who you could tell what their favourite outfit was, because they'd wear it ALL THE DAMN TIME. And after a while it just looked ridiculous.

							The basics:
							<dl>
								<dt>Stick to somewhat muted colors</dt>
								<dd>This means stuff like white, grey, faded blue, faded red, dark green, stuff like that. Leave the neon orange snapbacks and the hot pink shorts on the rack.</dd>
								<dt>Avoid large prints, designs and pretty much anything too crazy</dt>
								<dd>The point of this style isn't to make a statement, it's just to wear stuff that looks nice and it's nice and stylish.</dd>
								<dt>Wear you clothes in a slightly slimmer fit</dt>
								<dd>One of the main reasons guys fail is because they either wear stuff that's too baggy, or they wear stuff that makes them look like a bodybuilder from the 80's desperate for everyone around to know they've been lifting.</dd>

							Layering up is easy too, for example if you just planned on wearing a t-shirt and jeans, just throw on a sweatshirt or button down over it and finish it off with your jacket and boom, you got 3 layers on and you barely had to do anything extra. This style also works well with streetwear looks because you can rock a longline tee and throw a bomber over it and instantly look more stylish than everyone else around you.

								<dt>The flannel plus t-shirt combo</dt>
								<dd>Now outfits with this combo are almost ALWAYS guaranteed to be fresh as fuck because you have LAYERS, and you can get some sick color combinations. Pair that with almost any pair of jeans or chinos and you're definitely gonna be turning heads at school, word, and basically anywhere you go. The beauty of the flannel is that you can match basically any colored t-shirt, henley, hoodie or tank top and it'll give your outfit that layered look. Uou can also even add a jacket or as another layer if it's colder out, making you look even more stylish because then people see that you can match all your layers at once. The other cool thing about this outfit is that you can basically wear whatever you want for shoes. This is an AMAZING fall outfit that will turn heads left and righ, and it works for winter too if you live somewhere where it doesn't get TOO cold.</dd>
								<dt>The bad boy outfit</dt>
								<dd>Basically, this outfit starts off with a dark pair of slimmer fit denim, I personally go for a dark blue wash or just straight up black, depending on what I'm gonna match it with. The second most important piece of the outfit that ties the whole look together is the boots. For the top half, I usually go for something simple like a plain tee or henley because the whole point of this outfit is to be simple and subtle, but still badass. Which is ehy you NEED to wear a dope jacket with it. I'd personally go for a leather jacket in black or brown, but if that's not your style, then you can go for a denim jacket or a bomber. The jacket should fall right at your waist, maybe an inch or two lower but no more than that. The sleeves should land right at your wrists and it should fit snug on your chest.</dd>
								<dt>The cardigan combo</dt>
								<dd>Now these cardigans are probably one of my favourite pieces to wear because they're so versatile. You can wear them with a t-shirt or button down, and can layer them up with a nice jacket. As long as pants go, you can always rock these with denim and depending on the color of the cardigan, you can even rock them with chinos or khakis. For shoes, I think these look best with chukka boots, but they also look fresh with any low top sneakers, like vans, converse, nikes, yeezys if you're rich, and so on.</dd>

							Also, I don't know what it is about these shirts but the second you put one on, they INSTANTLY make your outfit look a lot more stylish and unique because they stand out so much more than just wearing a regular t-shirt like most guys do. They also match really well with casual styles like under a jacket or under a button down shirt, or a hoodie. They even work really well as a standalone piece as well because they make your outfit look a lot edgier and unique.

							Don't be afraid to break the rules. But by adding just one unusual piece to your outfit that makes you stand out from other peopleyou'lel be perceived as cooler. An unusual pair of shoes, a really nice watch, something in a really stand-out color, or whatever you like. You can aslo do this in a work environment. If you're wearing a typical grey, navy, or black suit, you can combine it with a bold colored button-down, or an unusual tie such as a knit tie or a bowtie. This will really help to elevate the distinctiveness of your outfit.

							The belts I've been wearing lately are Anson Belts because their belts are easily interchangeable with all their buckles and make it super convenient to match my belts and buckles with my badass outfits. Anson belts are one-of-a-kind because they're a micro-adjustable, hole-less belt instead of having 5 holes like most traditional belts. There are NO HOLES in an Anson Belt, but rather a tiny track system sewn into the back of the strap so you can adjust it 30+ ways and always have the perfect fit on your waist without having to deal with making new holes. Because of this your belt will stay preserved and looking dope for a really long time, since there are no holes to create that nasty belt crease that makes your belt all worn out. With Anson belts, all their buckles and straps are interchangable so you can have a ton of different masculine looks to match all your buckles with. For example with their 3 straps and 2 buckle box you can make 6 different complete belt looks. On top of that the belts come with a LIFETIME guarantee so if it ever quits working, they'll repair or replace it for you.
